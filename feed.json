            "content_html": "\n  <p>\n    Product dependency rules are an important tool for any business that sells multiple products or services. These rules help ensure that sales quotes are accurate and complete by taking into account any interdependencies between products. This is particularly important in the HVAC industry, where systems often require multiple components to function properly.<br><br>For example, a sales quote for an HVAC system may need to include not only the cost of the unit itself, but also the cost of installation, any necessary ductwork, and any additional components such as thermostats or air filters. Without proper product dependency rules in place, it is easy for sales reps to overlook these additional costs, leading to mistakes on the quote and potentially causing issues later on.<br><br>Implementing better product dependency rules can help eliminate these mistakes by ensuring that all necessary components and costs are accounted for in the sales quote. This can be done through the use of software that automatically checks for dependencies, or through the use of a checklist that sales reps must follow when preparing quotes. By taking these steps, businesses can increase the accuracy of their quotes and improve the overall customer experience.\n  </p>",
